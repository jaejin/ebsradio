Execuse my ignorance, but why do you think people are so ~~a touched~~*attached* to their
fist love?  
~~everydonely~~*Evidently*, the first ~~memory~~*experience* is always powerful and it remains in
your mind for a long time.  
i guess the first of *its kind* becomes a *permanent fixture* in your memory  

I agree. No matter what the first love is special because it can only
happen once.  

You also undergo your first ~~hurt ~~*heart*break  with your first love and that
makes it even more memorable.   

it's any case, just keep it to yourself and stop pissing around.
You're making a ~~pool~~*fool* of yourself.
